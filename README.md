# Introduction
Hey there! That's a simple python app, which detects your screenshot or  copied image and detects text and image.

# Prerequisites
1. Install dependencies
2. Install Tesseract-OCR
   # 1st Step
Open your terminal, and write the following command: 
```python
pip install pytesseract pillow pyautogui opencv-python
```
And then wait until all depedencies installed.
   # 2nd Step
You need to visit Tesseract-OCR Repository [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases/latest), and install a program from installer.

## :warning: Warning
This program does not support any other languages except english, and if you want to generate ASCII art, you need to get clean image without any text. 

That's it!
